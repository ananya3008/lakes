### Abstract

This research examines and analyzes historical changes in water levels of 25 endangered lakes worldwide, highlighting their critical ecological importance to life on Earth. Freshwater lakes are vital ecosystems that support biodiversity, provide water for human consumption and agriculture, and play a crucial role in climate regulation. However, many of these water bodies are increasingly threatened by urbanization, climate change, irregular rainfall patterns, and rising global temperatures. As a result, numerous lakes continue to dry up, leading to environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, and economic consequences for local communities. This situation underscores the urgent need for proactive conservation efforts by governments, civic organizations, and local communities to protect these irreplaceable resources.

The study focuses on 25 endangered lakes, including prominent examples such as the **Aral Sea**, **Lake Poop√≥** (Bolivia), **Puzhal Lake** (India), **Sawa Lake** (Iraq), **Lake Urmia** (Iran), and other lesser-known but equally threatened bodies of water across the globe. The research utilizes satellite data from the **LANDSAT-7** satellite, spanning from 1984 to the present, to monitor and analyze changes in water levels over time. A novel algorithm has been developed to automate the preprocessing of this satellite imagery, including the removal of cloud cover, rescaling images to uniform dimensions, and extracting historical data on water content. This algorithm then generates temporal plots and real-scale visualizations of water level trends, allowing for a clear representation of the dynamics affecting these lakes over the decades.

The research also paves the way for future work in predictive analytics by applying **machine learning** techniques. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) will be trained on the historical data in a time-series recursive fashion. This model will learn the patterns in the water level changes and lake morphology over time, with the goal of forecasting future conditions for each lake on a yearly basis. The predictions generated by this model can be invaluable for policymakers and conservationists in making informed decisions about water management, conservation strategies, and climate adaptation.

This work provides important insights into the ecological challenges faced by endangered lakes, offering actionable data for researchers, policymakers, and conservationists who are working to mitigate the effects of environmental change. By incorporating cutting-edge machine learning techniques into this analysis, the project offers a new approach to predicting and addressing the threats to freshwater ecosystems. 

This research is an important step towards understanding the impact of human activities and climate change on global freshwater resources and serves as a foundation for future conservation efforts aimed at preserving these critical ecosystems.
